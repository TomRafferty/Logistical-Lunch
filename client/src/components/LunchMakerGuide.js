            have to prepare the meals for the rest of the class. Students will have to
            select their requirements before Thursday each week. The requirements
            provided by them are all available to you. Please note the following:
            numbers of meals, dietary restrictions and dietary requirements. You will
            need to keep this in mind when you are choosing the recipe you would like to
            prepare. The name of the lunch shopper is given to you so you can
